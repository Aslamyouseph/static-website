    <p class="tracking_paragraph">There’s no better way to explore the majestic Indian Himalayas than to get your two feet working up and down the rugged trails, vast valleys, lush meadows, and dense forests. Yes, trekking in the Indian Himalayas is a larger than life experience that not only brings about a huge rush of adrenaline but also offers an insight into varied remote coexisting cultures.
      The Indian Himalayas are home to numerous treks, some popular, some lesser-known, while some still awaiting to be discovered. So, whether you are a beginner with dreams of traversing far & wide in the Indian Himalayas or a seasoned trekker seeking challenging treks in the remotest parts, India has it all ready for you.
      Trekking in India is about constantly changing landscapes and crossover treks in Himachal, whereas, in Uttarakhand, it is an experience of sacred sites and Pandavas-traversed routes that make the major attractions. In Sikkim, it is about exploring the ancient villages and witnessing jaw-dropping views of the world’s third tallest peak, Khangchendzonga, while in Ladakh, the experience entails traversing vast valleys and meadows, and numerous high altitude passes
      Wherever you choose to plan your trekking adventure in India, just know that no two experiences in the country are alike. In fact, a trekking experience can also vary in unimaginable ways in two different seasons. The summer treks are about verdant trails adorned with plum and rhododendron blossoms, whereas, the monsoon treks can be a bit challenging but absolutely unforgettable. The winter treks, on the other side, are about braving the several feet thick snow and relishing the vistas of perfect whiteout moments, such is the magic of Indian Himalayas.
